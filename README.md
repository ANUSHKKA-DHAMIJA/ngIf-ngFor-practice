# ngIf-ngFor-practice
This project is used to understand the implementation of the structural directives in Angular.

### Structural Directive
This type of directive is used to make changes in the layout of the DOM. Elements can be added or removed, hence changing the structure of the DOM. An example would be *ngIf(adding or removing element from DOM) or *ngFor(lists elements of everyÂ iteration).
